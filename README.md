# Text Summarization using Transformers

This project leverages transformer models to perform automatic text summarization. The aim is to extract and generate concise summaries of long text documents while preserving the key points and information. By using pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, or T5, this project demonstrates how state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques can be applied to the task of summarization.

## Key Features:
- **Text Summarization**: Automatically generate summaries of long texts by utilizing transformer models.
- **Pre-trained Models**: Uses popular pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, or T5 to provide high-quality text summarization.
- **Customizable**: Users can experiment with different models and fine-tune them for specific datasets or domains.
- **Support for Multiple Formats**: Input text can be provided through files, direct input, or from online sources.

## Tech Stack:
- **Libraries**: Hugging Face Transformers, PyTorch, TensorFlow
- **Pre-trained Models**: BERT, GPT, T5
- **Frameworks**: Python, Jupyter Notebook
